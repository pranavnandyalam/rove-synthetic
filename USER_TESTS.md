# User Testing Plan and Notes

## Test Scenarios
- Search JFK → ORD, date next month, miles 30,000
- Search SFO → LAX, date next month, miles 8,000
- Invalid input: empty origin, past date
- Low miles case: 3,000 miles

## What to Observe
- Page loads and shows example VPM before search
- Recommendations appear with type, direct/connecting, price, miles needed, VPM
- Feedback form submission succeeds and shows a thank-you message

## Notes
- Performance (seconds to load)
- Clarity (is the ranking understandable?)
- Accuracy (does VPM feel reasonable?)
- Issues/bugs encountered
